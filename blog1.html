<p><i>Although by no means I am an expert. This is the advice that I would like to give my self  back when  I started to learn coding , and by following these tips I could see myself being clearly much further than I am today. So it would be helpful for someone who just started with their coding journey. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<p>I started coding after I saw<a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOUoHARfMe8&t=6s"> Varun mayya's video on 21 skills for 21 days</a>  in which he said to learn the MERN stack ,and I also knew that JS is the way to go as I was a discord member of <a class="link"  href="https://t.me/teamtanay"> #teamtanay</a>. So I spend all my savings  and got an entry level laptop as soon buying stuff online was allowed during the lockdown. </p>

<h3>So that the context is out of the way here are the tips.
</h3>
<br>

<h2>Start with the very basic (HTML & CSS).</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/blog1.svg"></div>

<p>After getting my brand new laptop I dove head first  and started learning the MERN stack. I got a course of around 50+ hours , I thought of it as a book or a series I have to rush through as I was watching the course I was understanding everything and was also having a lot of fun coding along the instructor . But after the course  was done I was asked by a developer friend of mine to code a simple JavaScript BMI calculator and I wasn't able to do it ! 
</p>

<p>after this happened if  I was any smarter I would've focused on learning ,the core fundamentals of web dev which is <strong>HTML,CSS AND JS</strong> .
</p>

<p>But instead I decide to go for trendy and cool projects with react . So this is the first thing  I would say to my Past self and a beginner dev . Focus on learning HTML CSS and JS in some depth ,by no means you have to be an expert in it but just enough to navigate your way through a tricky situation .</p>

<p>For that I would recommend <a  class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8cl_8ktp9M&list=PLzvhQUIpvvug-c-bExl_xFcopeQi_sa29">Tanay Sir's 1st course</a>  for various reasons that I would explain in depth below, the course is small with  videos being 10-15min  and you would be done in a day with hosting your own very first website.</p>

<h3>This course is made to spark your interest in learning code.
</h3>
<br>

<h2>Make small projects and DONT copy!.</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/7tB6CL9HF.png"></div>

<p>As I explained in my previous point that I rushed through the courses just for the sake of completing them. And after that what I did was make cool projects that I see on Youtube and just code along with the video and thus learned nothing .</p>

<p>This is the second advice I would give myself and a beginner dev that focus on small simple projects and try to enjoy the small wins like adding a feature or fixing a bug I used to compare myself with younger devs without realizing that they learned for a lot longer then me so comparing myself with them wasn't fair to me as I just started. And due to this unfair comparison I pushed myself to make cooler projects and hence not learning anything about coding in the process .</p>
<br>

<h2>Get comfortable reading DOCS</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/Fknu2OtKf.png"></div>

<p>When I started coding I would never used to read docs and thus only make/do things only if there was a Youtube video explaining it . Reading docs is a very useful skill as a developer and I wish I started doing it sooner rather than later I know it can be tricky and a hassle when you get started but trust me it isn't as difficult as it looks .</p>

<p>By going through docs not only you can make better projects <strong>you also get the confidence to take on any projects and figure things out on your own!</strong>  , this is a very important mindset to have for anything in life but especially for programming and web dev.</p>
<br>

<h2>Playing the Game is more important then Winning and Losing</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/N-iJyZpXp.png"></div>

<p>
    <blockquote >
        When we copy the code and use it, we don't practice anything. We might get the desired outcome, but the long term result is regretful. -Tanay Pratap.
    </blockquote>
</p>
This one is a mindset change rather than tactical one. But this is the most important skill I thing I gained from watching and listening to Tanay sir's teaching as I wrote in my previous points I would rush through my courses and thus waste time watching them rather than actually learning.
<p>

    <p>It was just an<i> illusion </i>of learning.</p>

</p>

<p>
    The main philosophy of Tanay sir's teaching is treating learning as a game and playing the game is the only thing that matters not wining nor losing . If you cheat you lose even though you win.
</p>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/Yx3hVcM2S.jpg"></div>

<p>When you get in this mindset you'll have way more fun learning anything and you will obviously learn more than just watching courses . How you may ask? before this you are in the mindset of having to complete the project only then you have <strong>"done something" </strong>so you don't get any dopamine hit when solving challenges that is <strong>required </strong> to get those project done so what you subconsciously do is to take the easiest way out that is watching the tutorial or copy pasting code from Github and/or stackoverflow. This doesn't help you in your learning at all.</p>

<p>But in the mindset of treating learning as Gaming . Solving every small challenge gives you pleasure/dopamine hit every time you solve a small issue or add a small feature ,which makes you feel good so you keep on doing it more and more which is <i>absolutely essential</i>  if you plan on getting good at anything, you cant get good without genuine interest in learning ,and this mindset-shift solves that problem and gets you interested in learning and solving problems rather than making projects just for the sake of it or to get a job.</p>
<br>

<h2>Don't give up when it gets hard.</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/Urx2xn1__.png"></div>

<blockquote>It takes 90% of the time to do the last 10% of the work .</blockquote>

<p>What I used to do is pick a very cool and robust project without having a understanding of the fundamental skills and then I rush through the video like a chore and then give up at the very end when it gets challenging and I don't get a dopamine hit from the project and it starts to feel boring.</p>

<p>This happened with me a lot especially at the very end of projects when it starts to get complex.</p>

<p>So if you are beginner dev I would recommend making super simple projects and adding on top of it rather than starting with a very complex project.</p>

<br>

<h2>Work on your own progress & stop comparing.</h2>

<div class="hero"><img class="hero-img" src="img/7tB6CL9HF.png"></div>

<p>Comparing my self to other guys who were much further than me was a big driver for me to work hard when I got started with learning to code although there are a lot of great benefits of having a very smart and ambitious peer group there is also some negatives.</p>

<p>When I started coding I use to see people much younger than me being very good at code and working on very cool Projects. This was one of the main reason I started rushing through the content of courses and got in a toxic habit of watching tutorials 8+hours a day for months without absorbing much information, and this was what lead to all the other points that I talked about in this blog .

</p>
So if you are a new dev or a #codenewbie don't compare yourself to the folks who have been learning and doing this for a while it is just an unfair comparison and this topic is very serious as it can get some folks <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sanketsahu/status/1330855242884210711?s=20"> depressed.</a>

<p>
    So if you've made it till here I hope you'll find this tips helpful or at the very least Entertaining. Let me know what you think about this article. I hope this tips will help you with your learning, and hopefully save your time ;) so you don't make these mistakes.
